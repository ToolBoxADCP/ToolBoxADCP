Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data processing toolbox and towed instruments 

To help analyse in situ measurements, a processing chain has been set up that automatically generates most of the graphs useful for analysing currents: dispersion ellipse, stickplot, etc. This chain is also linked to Foreman's tool to simultaneously deduce the tidal characteristics associated with these measurements. This software is available on Zenodo.
